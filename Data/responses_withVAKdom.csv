However, I feel like the only thing that stresses me is myself. Once I deal with that, I have no issue and won't look at the situation as an unfortunate condition anymore. I can handle the assignments, I can handle the test. Those things did not give me stress. Lack of self-motivation made me not wanting to listen to recorded lecture videos. That's the only issue I have with myself. Physical classes require time. The duration to move from one place to another takes time. If my class starts at 10am, I can get ready at 9.50am. From my perspective, there are a lot of benefits to be honest. However, I understand the frustration that others are having. ",Arts and Social Sciences,International and Strategic Studies,Visual

This leads to a lot of issues with getting behind class. Better options include prerecorded video lectures, asynchronous video lectures, guided lecture notes, suggested youtube/online sources from lecturer, guided by book learning pace.

On the side note, I have no issues with this but a lot of other students do as far as I know, making videos is better than making ppsx. Many people have older version of computers so they cannot watch or hear that format. Better to just stick to powerpoint with recorded voicenotes or export to video formats such as mp4, etc.
