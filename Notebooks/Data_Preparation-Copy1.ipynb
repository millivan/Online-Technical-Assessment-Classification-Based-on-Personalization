To clean and extract useful data from this column, NLTK is first used to remove common words (stopwords), next to do lemmatization so that the data becomes slightly more manageable. Then, the lemmatized data is checked for the occurrence of common instructional strategies, such as \"YouTube\", \"Live Lecture\", and so on."
